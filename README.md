Breezy-GTK 3.26
---------------

A GTK / Gnome-Shell theme using a few colors from the Breeze color palette and a few that aren't.

Installation:

NOTE: You must have the user themes extension enabled. This can be done easily with Gnome-Tweak-Tool.

Unzip breezy-gtk-master.zip and copy the breezy-gtk-master folder to /home/yourusername/.themes

Tip: Use Gnome-Tweak-Tool to change both your GTK and Shell themes.

Issues
------------
Seems to have funny issues after first setting the theme (e.g. red checkboxes), these go away after reboot.

Changelog
------------
0.1 - Initial commit

0.2 - Removed transparency from shell theme. This results in the panel and menus better matching the window headers and improves readability in the menus.

0.3 - Added borders to shell menus so that they don't blend into gtk+ elements like headerbars. This made the theme look much nicer with the default Gnome-Shell desktop setup.

0.4 - Fixed issue with shell theme that resulted in the default panel.solid color (black) taking over the panel when a window was full screen or near the panel. 

3.26 - Changed versioning to match Gnome releases and made some refinements to the Gnome-Shell theme.

! In the process of renaming the theme from "Breezy-GTK" to "Afflatus", then I will rebase the GTK theme on the current version of Materia instead of flat-plat. After that I will work on new color variations. !
