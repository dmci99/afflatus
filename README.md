Breezy-GTK 0.3
---------------

A GTK / Gnome-Shell theme using a few colors from the Breeze color palette and a few that aren't.

Installation:

NOTE: You must have the user themes extension enabled. This can be done easily with Gnome-Tweak-Tool.

Unzip breezy-gtk-master.zip and copy the breezy-gtk-master folder to /home/yourusername/.themes

Tip: Use Gnome-Tweak-Tool to change both your GTK and Shell themes.

A version with light window headers is in the works.

Issues
------------
Seems to have funny issues after first setting the theme (e.g. red checkboxes), these go away after reboot.

Changelog
------------
0.1 - Initial commit

0.2 - Removed transparency from shell theme. This results in the panel and menus better matching the window headers and improves readability in the menus.

0.3 - Added borders to shell menus so that they don't blend into gtk+ elements like headerbars. This made the theme look much nicer with the default Gnome-Shell desktop setup.
