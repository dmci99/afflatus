#Breezy-GTK

A GTK / Gnome-Shell theme using a few colors from the Breeze color palette and a few that aren't.

Installation:

NOTE: You must have the user themes extension enabled. This can be done easily with Gnome-Tweak-Tool.

Unzip breezy-gtk-master.zip and copy the breezy-gtk-master folder to /home/yourusername/.themes

Tip: Use Gnome-Tweak-Tool to change both your GTK and Shell themes.

Breezy-GTK currently looks best with Dash to Panel and Arc Menu/App Menu. A version with light window headers is in the works. Currently the dark top panel in Gnome-Shell clashes with the dark window header and doesn't look very good when windows are maximized. This, and a few other things will soon be fixed!
